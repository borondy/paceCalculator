# paceCalculator
Basic Node app for calculating running paces, for interval trainings. 
<p> Bit overkill since this could have been solved with somefront end only solution, but I wanted to play a bit with Node, Express and mostly PUG :) </p>

After <code>npm i</code> you can run the app with <code> npm start</code>.
